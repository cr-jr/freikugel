* Summary

GNU Guix is incredibly powerful and shifted how I think about system administration in ways that made it actually painful to use other distros after it.

* Why Guix?

[[https://guix.gnu.org][GNU Guix]] is a declarative, transactional package manager developed on the shoulders of Nix that is capable of creating entirely reproducible machine configurations.

Below, I emphasize some of the things I love about it. If you really want to dig into what Guix is about, [[https://ambrevar.xyz/guix-advance/][this article is an excellent primer]].

** Declarative

Guix configurations are written in Guile scheme. Everything from package definitions to system configurations use it under the hood. This provides me with the power of a full programming language and nearly infinite capability to extend and modify my
system the way I want.

** Transactional

Its transactional nature means that builds either succeed or fail with no chance of falling into a partially updated limbo. Guix maintains the history of each transaction as /generations/ which can be toggled and rolled backed, effectively preserving the last working state.

** Reproducible

Its reproducibility means that the system can effectively replicate itself under vastly different contexts. Which allows me to do insane shit like creating a virtual machine image to lab a major change to my environment without affecting the host
machine or a disk image so I can take my exact computing environment /anywhere/.

** Environment Isolation

Guix allows a clean separation between system state and user state. Each user can have their own version of Guix coexisting with their particular package definitions. My three favorite features converge here to vanquish dependency hell as
every package can be locked to a given version, while allowing multiple versions of itself and in-place updates. That's right... You can update packages without fear that it'll affect some other package.

And I must say this again—every operation is transactional. Even user package management. Guix maintains a separate generation list for each user with the same superpowers as system generations.

* Setup

The first thing I need to rebuild my system is a Guix installation image. That said, I can't use the standard one because my machine uses proprietary components. Lucky for me, [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][the nonguix project exists]].

This excellent repo provides a Guix channel containing "non-free" packages. The ones I need in particular are the standard Linux kernel and firmware.

** Nonguix channel

Before anything else will work, I need the Guix channel declaration. During installation, this channel will be pulled in so I can use the packages from it to build my system.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle system/etc/guix/channels.scm
(cons* (channel
        (name 'nonguix)
        (url "https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix")
        ;; Enable signature verification:
        (introduction
         (make-channel-introduction
          "897c1a470da759236cc11798f4e0a5f7d4d59fbc"
          (openpgp-fingerprint
           "2A39 3FFF 68F4 EF7A 3D29  12AF 6F51 20A0 22FB B2D5"))))
       %default-channels)
#+END_SRC

This snippet is generated as =channels.scm= and should be dropped into =/etc/guix= for the system to use. /User/ channel declarations should live at =~/.config/guix=.

Next, run =guix pull= to tell the system about the channel.

** Installation Image

*** System Crafters

System Crafters provides [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/guix-installer/releases][a ready-to-roll disk image]] with the nonguix packages (and a few extras). This is my preferred way.

*** Guix (Manually)

To create the image from /within/ Guix, use the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
guix system image --image-size=800MiB /path/to/freikugel/system/install.scm
#+END_SRC

Where =install.scm= contains:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme

;; Generate a bootable image (e.g. for USB sticks, etc.) with:
;; $ guix system disk-image nongnu/system/install.scm

(define-module (nongnu system install)
  #:use-module (gnu system)
  #:use-module (gnu system install)
  #:use-module (nongnu packages linux)
  #:export (installation-os-nonfree))

(define installation-os-nonfree
  (operating-system
    (inherit installation-os)
    (kernel linux)
    (firmware (list linux-firmware))))

installation-os-nonfree
#+END_SRC

Next, I need to get the image on a USB stick.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# /dev/sdb is an example. The actual device may vary
dd if=/path/to/disk-image of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
#+END_SRC

* Installation

This section assumes I've loaded the installation media and selected the manual installation process.

** 1. Partition the disks

My disk is split into four partitions. The EFI system partition, swap space, the root filesystem, and my home directory. I use =cfdisk= to create the partitions as follows:

|-------------+-------------+--------+-----------------|
| Device      | Mount Point | Label  | Size            |
|-------------+-------------+--------+-----------------|
| =/dev/sda1= | =/boot/efi= | =BOOT= | 512MB           |
| =/dev/sda2= | [swap]      | =SWAP= | 16GB            |
| =/dev/sda3= | =/=         | =ROOT= | 128GB           |
| =/dev/sda4= | =/home=     | =HOME= | remaining space |

** 2. Create and mount filesystems

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# /
mkfs.ext4 -L ROOT /dev/sda3; mount LABEL=ROOT /mnt

# /boot/efi
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1; fatlabel /dev/sda1 BOOT; mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi; mount LABEL=BOOT /mnt/boot/efi

# /home
mkfs.ext4 -L HOME /dev/sda4; mkdir /mnt/home; mount LABEL=HOME /mnt/home

# Swap space
mkswap -L SWAP /dev/sda2; swapon LABEL=SWAP
#+END_SRC

** 3. Connect to the internet

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Unblock network interface
rfkill unblock all

# Connect
ip link set wlan0 up
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c <(wpa_passphrase ssid passphrase)
dhclient -v wlan0

# Test
ping -c 3 gnu.org
#+END_SRC

** 4. Initialize cow-store

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
herd start cow-store /mnt
#+END_SRC

** 4. Clone the repo

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/cr-jr/freikugel.git
#+END_SRC

** 5. Prep the nonguix channels

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# copy locally for the installation
mkdir -p .config/guix; cp -v freikugel/system/etc/guix/channels.scm .config/guix

# copy to the host system
mkdir -p /mnt/etc/guix; cp -v freikugel/system/etc/guix/channels.scm /mnt/etc/guix

# update and check
guix pull && hash guix
#+END_SRC

** 6. Initialize the new system

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cp -v freikugel/system/etc/config.scm /mnt/etc
guix system init /mnt/etc/config.scm /mnt
#+END_SRC

** 7. Reboot

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
reboot
#+END_SRC
